-- In a Union, you are stacking rows together from two or more data sources. This can be particularly useful for situations where you get similar data from different source systems.
-- Run this code to understand how a UNION works.

-- Note that you may need to specify the schema before you table name. For example, my schema name is 'public', so I could have written 'public.immunizations' in the from portions of the UNION.
